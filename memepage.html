<h1>Intro To Basketball</h1>

<p> So when I was little I didn't like basketball that much as a sport. My dad wanted me to play it at the YMCA, I did but I didn't enjoy it all that much, it wasn't until I was older that I started to appreciate the sport.</p>

<h2>Kobe</h2>

<p> When I did get into basketball though, my favorite player by far was Kobe Bryant, just like my dad, I loved Kobe's playstyle. Because of this, I adopted the Lakers as my favorite team.

<h2>Lakers</h2>

<p> So the Lakers are my favorite team, I like all the legends that have been on the Lakers; Wilt Chamberlain, Kobe, Shaq, Magic Johnson, the list goes on. The Lakers are the best team in Basketball history.

<h2> Outro </h2>

<p> So now I just casually play basketball with my friends and my dad every once and a while. I also play the basketball video game called 2k and of course I watch basketball when it's on season.</p>
